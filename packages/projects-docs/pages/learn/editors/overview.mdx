# Editors

Productivity is key when working in an editor. For this reason, we have embedded our CodeSandbox features within the powerful and well loved VS Code.
There are two editor versions to choose from - web and desktop. All Sandboxes and Devboxes open in the web editor by default. However, you can select your prefered editor when you open a new Devbox or import a repo.

## Web

The web editor is a customized version of [VS Code for the web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web). This hybrid editor provides the familiarity and comfort of VS Code without leaving CodeSandbox.
All CodeSandbox DevTools, such as previews, tasks, and shared terminals, are nested under the “CodeSandbox DevTools” panel on the left sidebar. From there, you can manage all these DevTools when needed, but most of these actions will still be performed automatically. For example, if your project has a task configured that runs the dev server on VM startup, it will automatically open the preview for you when you open the project.

## Desktop

VS Code Desktop offers the local VS Code experience with your own configurations and shortcuts whilst remaining connected to the CodeSandbox development environment.

**Install the CodeSandbox VS Code extension and open any branch or Devbox directly in your VS Code editor.**

## Which editor is right for you?

Each editor brings its own benefits and drawbacks. Depending on the configuration you desire or the requirements of your project, you my find that one editor satisfies your needs more than the other.
