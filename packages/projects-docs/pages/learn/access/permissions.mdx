# User Permissions

Permissions vary slightly between repositories, which extend the settings from GitHub, and Sandboxes, which solely exist in CodeSandbox.

## Browser and VM Sandboxes
### Private
Private Sandboxes can only be accessed by members of the workspace that owns the Sandbox.

### Unlisted 
Unlisted Sandboxes are accessible by workspace members and non-workspace members with the URL.

### Public
Public Sandboxes are visible to everyone. Public Sandboxes are a great option for sharing content with people outside the workspace. Non-workspace members are able to open and run public Sandboxes. In order to edit, however, they will need to fork the Sandbox to their own workspace. 

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
VMs used to run public previews will be charged to the workspace that owns the VM Sandbox.
</Callout>

If you want to share a VM Sandbox publicly, consider turning it into a template. That way, the runtime of the VMs used to run the code and/or the preview won't be charged to your workspace.


Default privacy settings for Sandboxes can be set in the workspace portal in the [permissions tab](https://codesandbox.io/t/permissions)

## Repositories

### Users with write access

Users with write access to a repository can enjoy the full feature set available on CodeSandbox Repositories.

### Users with read-only access 

Users with read-only access to the repository can browse the content of the repository, check the previews and execute a few tasks. To introduce changes, they need to create a contribution branch or fork the repository. For more information, visit the [open source collaboration](/learn/getting-started/open-source) page.

### Anonymous users

Users without a CodeSandbox account can only browse the content of the project and interact with the previews.

## Feature comparative guide
