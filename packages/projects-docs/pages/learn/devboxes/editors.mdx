# Editors

CodeSandbox offers two different development environments A browser based Sandbox and Cloud based Devbox.

Devboxes run inside a Firecracker MicroVM and utilise memory snapshotting to ensure fast fork time and wake up time. They can run anything that you would be able to run in your local environment, including Docker containers. You can learn more about how they work in our [blog post](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds).

Devboxes are best used to run backend services, compiled languages and things like databases.

The Devbox editor contains a set of features to increase the accessibility of complex tools like git, setup, review flows, contributions, and visualizing components.

    Sandboxes run fully in the browser, and are made to run frontend JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks. If you would like to run backend services or databases, check Devboxes.
