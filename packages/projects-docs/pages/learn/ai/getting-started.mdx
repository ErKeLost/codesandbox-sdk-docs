# Getting Started

All CodeSandbox AI tools are available to Free and Pro users. To enable these features, admins need to grant permissions in the [workspace settings](https://codesandbox.io/t/permissions).

Once you grant AI permissions, you are accepting Codeium's terms and conditions.
You can read more about their terms of service on the [Codeium website](https://codeium.com/terms-of-service-individual).

Here is a short list of their security & privacy policies:

- Opt-out for code snippet telemetry.
- Never train generative models on private code.
- SOC 2 compliance.
- No training on non-permissively licensed code.

## Running AI

Once permissions have been granted, you need to restart the VMs for the changes to take effect. You can do this by selecting `Restart Branch` in the main menu. If you are in a Devbox, the option will read `Restart Sandbox`.
