# Codeium code auto-complete

Codeium is an incredible AI-powered developer toolkit. Their code completion tool provides single and multi-line code generation with multiple suggestions to choose from. It supports 70+ programming languages, so itâ€™s a perfect fit with our Devboxes, which can also run any type of project.

## Getting started

Codeium code completion is now available for free to every CodeSandbox user on [Devboxes](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/recent?create_devbox=true).

If you have your AI settings enabled, you will get AI autocomplete working in your code immediately. Note that we disable AI permission toggles by default, so if you have not yet enabled them, you will have a chance to do so through our announcement interfaces or through the workspace settings.

## Settings and configuration

In the workspace settings, you will see an option to turn on AI for devboxes and sandboxes in the workspace.
If you want to override these settings for a particular repository or devbox, you can open the editor, navigate to settings > preferences and turn off the AI option. This will deactivate AI for all users accessing the devbox or repo.
