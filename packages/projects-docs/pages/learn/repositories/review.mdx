# Using CodeSandbox for code reviews
CodeSandbox branches are the perfect place to conduct code reviews. Simply open the branch from the GitHub PR and see the code changes, running preview and conversations all in one place. 

Reviews on CodeSandbox are synced with GitHub. It doesn't matter if you start a review in GitHub and finish it in CodeSandbox, all comments will be reflected in both GitHub and CodeSandbox. 

## Getting started
Reviews require a repository admin to install the [GitHub App](/learn/integrations/github-app). Once that is installed, you will see a comment in your GitHub PR with links to open the branch and the preview. 

## How it works
Once a PR is created, you will see links to the CodeSandbox branch. If you open the branch in the web editor, you will see something like the following

### Reviewers
All the of the requested reviewers and their review status are listed at the top of the PR tab. If they have left a message with their review, you can view that by selecting the chevron to the left of their name.

### Changes by file
All the changes are listed in this section. 
At this time, comments are only shown on diff files.

### Comments
You can add a comment by opening a diff file, and hovering your mouse between the line numbers to see a plus button.
