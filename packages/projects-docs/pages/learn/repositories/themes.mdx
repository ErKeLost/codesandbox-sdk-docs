## Overview

CodeSandbox maps themes of Visual Studio Code extensions to apply over the editor. Currently, it only offers a set of preset themes, including various dark and light themes:

- CodeSandbox (dark / light)
- [GitHub's Default (dark / light)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
- [Vesper (dark)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raunofreiberg.vesper)
- [Dracula (dark)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)
- [poimandres (dark)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmndrs.pmndrs)

## Configure

There are two ways to switch themes:
- Access the command palette in the editor using <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and search by `themes`.
- Open the Project settings and select the **Themes** tab.
