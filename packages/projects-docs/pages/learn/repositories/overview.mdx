# CodeSandbox Repositories

CodeSandbox allows you to instantly spin up a cloud development environment for any branch in your GitHub repository. It has a focus on speed and collaboration and allows you to create a workspace to be experienced by multiple people at the same time.

## Tailored for your project

Much like [Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview), repositories are run in CodeSandbox VMs that enhance productivity and make overall development more accessible for developers of all levels.

## Integrated with source control

CodeSandbox brings a unique approach to cloud development by giving a dedicated VM to every branch, which can be shared with a URL. This means that you can share your branch and it will always be running, even if you’re offline.

This feature is specially useful when you’re working on a branch and need to quickly [review a PR](./review). Don't worry about stashing, running `yarn install`, or rolling back migrations on your current branch. Just open the PR in a new window and start reviewing!

## A running environment in seconds

When you press `Create Branch`, we automatically create a new branch and set up a development environment with running dev servers within a few seconds by cloning the VM you branch from. You can read more about how this works in our [blog](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds).

If you are looking at someone’s PR and want to quickly test a suggestion, simply click `Create Branch`, write the code and share a link to your changes. If you’re happy with the changes, merge that into the existing PR. All of this in under a minute.
