# Dev Containers

CodeSandbox supports Dev Containers spec natively. Dev Containers is an open specification for setting up and running containers for development environments. With Dev Containers you can setup the development environment using existing container images or build your own with custom Dockerfile. You can also run additional services like databases, caches etc with Docker Compose. Dev Containers also lets you add features on top of the container so that you can enhance your development environment without modifying the Dockerfile or the base image.

You can read more about the spec and configuration at the [Dev Container website](https://containers.dev/)

If you have already configured containers with our legacy Docker integration, we advise you to move to Dev Containers. You can still [read the docs for Docker integration here](/learn/environment/docker)

## Configuring Dev Containers in CodeSandbox

Configuring Dev Containers in CodeSandbox is similar to how you do in a local VSCode environment. If you already have a configuration then it should work out of the box in CodeSandbox.

CodeSandbox also has a onboarding tool that allows you to configure Dev Containers via the UI. You can read more about the onboarding tool [here](/learn/repositories/setting-up-repository#environment-setup) 

CodeSandbox uses rootless [Podman](https://podman.io/) to run the containers. We also use the [devcontainer/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) to build and manage devcontainers.

While CodeSandbox supports most of the Dev Containers spec, there are some caveats. Majority of the Dev Container configurations should work as expected but if it does not you can take a look at the [limitations](#limitations) section below.

### Limitations

The following properties in Dev Container config may work slightly different from other Dev Container implementation.


- `forwardPorts`: CodeSandbox does not need this property. All ports opened in Dev Containers will be mapped to a public URL automatically.
- `portsAttributes`: CodeSandbox does not yet support this property. Ports are attached to tasks configured in .codesandbox/tasks.json and are attributed to the tasks.
- `otherPortsAttributes`: CodeSandbox does not yet support this property.
- `remoteUser`: CodeSandbox currently ignores this property and overrides this as root. CodeSandbox uses rootless Podman to run containers. Running with a non-root remote user is the same as running as a root remote user in rootless Podman, from a security perspective. CodeSandbox plans on supporting this in the future.
- `shutdownAction`:	Does not apply to CodeSandbox.
- `capAdd`: CodeSandbox does not support adding all capabilities. As the containers are run as a non-root user, capabilities that need root access will not work.
- `features`: CodeSandbox automatically adds docker-cli to the container and connects to the host socket. Features like docker-in-docker and docker-outside-of-docker will work a bit differently. As the docker-cli and socket from host are accessible in the container, most use cases should work as expected.
- `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`	Any	For CodeSandbox, the host is in the cloud rather than in your local machine.
hostRequirements: CodeSandbox does not yet support this property.
