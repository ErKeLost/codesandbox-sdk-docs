# Boxy FAQs

### How does Boxy differ from ChatGPT?
Although Boxy is built using GPT at its core, one key distinguishing factor is that Boxy is aware of the code in your sandbox or repository. As a result, Boxy's suggestions will consider existing patterns in your project's code.

### How do I get access to Boxy?
Boxy and all CodeSandbox AI-powered tools are available to Personal Pro and Team Pro users. You can [upgrade](https://codesandbox.io/pro) or [start a free trial](https://codesandbox.io/pro?team) to experience development with Boxy.
