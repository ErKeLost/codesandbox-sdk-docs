***Keep chatting***
Boxy remembers your previous conversations and takes them into account when provided responses. For example, if you have asked Boxy to include the filepath for the suggested code repeatedly in the past, it will include it in future responses.

***Request response formats***
Do you prefer that Boxy always provides suggestions in insertable snippets? Or do you prefer to see the code situated within the full file? Ask Boxy to `"always respond with ___"` in order to recieve suggestions in the way you like. 

***When in doubt, provide more context***
Boxy will give you what you ask for. They may make suggestions based on the way your frame your question. Boxy may have better responses when you ask them to consider specific files or libraries that may contain useful context for your question.
