CodeSandbox provides instant development environments that get you up and running quickly and keep you in flow.

We provide dozens of templates to start from or the option to import your own repository or Sandbox.

The code can run on either the browser or in a virutal machine. Projects that run in the browser are called Sandboxes and projects that run on virtual machines (VMs) are called Devboxes.

## Devboxes

Devboxes are powerful and versatile. Offering support for a wide range of language and frameworks. Devboxes are built to scale as your project grows. Learn more about Devboxes and VM runtimes [here](/learn/devboxes/overview)

To use CodeSandbox for cloud development with a strong GitHub integration, we recommend using [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

## Sandboxes

Sandboxes, on the other hand are ideal for prototyping and sharing code snippets.
When using Sandboxes, your code is evaluated and run in our built-in execution environment. These client environments run entirely inside of your browser and will continue to bundle your code even when you lose your connection to our servers.

Sandboxes each have their own bundler attached to them which is configured to support a specific framework and emulate their official CLI tools. They are not one-to-one implementations and thus do not support advanced configuration like custom webpack configurations or ejecting. However, they are designed to mirror the default behavior of the framework.

## Editors

Both Sandboxes and Devboxes run on a version of VS Code for the web. You can learn more about the editor [here](/learn/editors/overview)
