# Drafts
Users have a personal drafts section in every workspace they are a part of. Drafts are intended to provide a private space to test ideas before sharing them with the workspace. 
All drafts are private and only editable by the creator. Once a draft is moved out of the draft folder, it become editable by anyone in the workspace. 

## Subscriptions and limits
On Free workspaces, users are only allowed 10 drafts, Pro workspaces provide unlimited drafts for their members. 

Note:
If you had over 10 drafts in the drafts folder when the draft restrictions were put in place, all old drafts would be made `restricted` meaning that they are `read-only` until the owner updates the privacy. 
This ensures that any Sandboxes that have been shared via embeds do not break until the owner has time to move the Sandbox to a workspace folder where sharing is encouraged.
