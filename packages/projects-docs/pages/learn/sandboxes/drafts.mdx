# Drafts

Workspace members have access to a personal Sandbox drafts section in every workspace to which they belong. Drafts are intended to provide a space to test ideas before sharing them with the workspace.

Drafts are the default location for all newly created Sandboxes. A location for a new Sandbox can be selected on creation or any time after the Sandbox has been created.

Drafts inherit the default privacy specified in the workspace settings. By default, Sandboxes are created as public. However, if the workspace settings restrict the creation of public Sandboxes, drafts will be created as private.

The drafts folder displays Sandboxes and Devboxes created by you, they can be shared with others according to their privacy setting. If you want the Sandbox to be easily discoverable by other workspace members, it is recommended to move the Sandbox out of drafts.
