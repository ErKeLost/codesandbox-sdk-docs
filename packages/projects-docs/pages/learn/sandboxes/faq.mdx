# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find live sessions?
To use live sessions, you will need to convert your sandbox to a devbox.

### What should I do if I need more space for file uploads?
Converting your sandbox to a devbox will provide you with more storage for your files.

### How does the CLI work with binary files?
When you deploy a sandbox using the CLI we automatically detect the binary files
and upload them to the CodeSandbox Storage Management after getting
confirmation.

### What happened to deployments?
Vercel deployments are still supported through CLI commands, but there is no longer an interface in sandboxes to support deployments.
