# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find live sessions?
{/* To use live sessions, you will need to convert your sandbox to a devbox. */}
Our new editor experience doesn't support Live Sessions yet, but it's on our roadmap. 
If you require Live Sessions you can opt out of our latest editor beta under Experiments in your Dashboard settings. 

### What should I do if I need more space for file uploads?
Converting your sandbox to a repository will provide you with more storage for your files. 

### How does the CLI work with binary files?
When you deploy a sandbox using the CLI we automatically detect the binary files
and upload them to the CodeSandbox Storage Management after getting
confirmation.

### What happened to deployments?
Vercel deployments are still supported through CLI commands, but there is no longer an interface in sandboxes to support deployments.

### Where can I find the tests tab?
We made the decision to remove the built in tests from browser Sandboxes. We unfortunately never found a way to make them work as consistently as we would have liked.
If your project requires tests we recommend using a Devbox. They will allow you to build and run your own tests within your project as needed.
