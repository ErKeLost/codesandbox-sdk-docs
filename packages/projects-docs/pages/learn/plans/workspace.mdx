# Workspaces

![Workspaces](../images/workspace-selector.png)

CodeSandbox uses **Workspaces** to provide boundaries for collaboration on CodeSandbox. [Personal workspace](#personal-workspace) are available to all users for public, individual development work. [Pro workspaces](#pro-workspace), on the other hand are reserved for any type of work requiring privacy or collaboration with others.

Every sandbox belongs to a workspace, and every branch of a repository has a separate development environment in each workspace. If you are working on something in one workspace and decide to collaborate with users that are on a different workspace, it may be necessary to transfer (in the case of a sandbox) or re-import (in the case of a repository) into workspace that your workspace members have access to.

## Getting started with workspaces

When you create an account, you will be taken through a flow to create your first workspace. From here you can choose to upgrade this workspace to Pro or continue using the free workspace.

## Free Workspace

Free workspaces are a great way to get started with CodeSandbox.
You may add members to your workspace at anytime by navigating to the workspace settings and sending an invite to their email.
You can also upgrade to pro at any time to experience CodeSandbox without limits.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
Currently, every account must be associated with at least one workspace. In the future, we will introduce more flexibility that will allow you to change and delete your primary workspace.
</Callout>

## Pro Workspaces

Pro workspaces are for private development and projects that require higher VM specs.

## Collaboration on workspaces

You can add as many members to a workspace as you like. You can invite them when you are creating the workspace for the first time, or later through the subscription management view.

![Invite team members](../images/workspace-invite-members.png)

Users with an active CodeSandbox account will get a notification (the bell icon in the header) in CodeSandbox as well as an email.
From there, they can accept or decline the invitation.

You can also invite workspace members that do not have a CodeSandbox account. They will be sent an email inviting them to create an account where they will have access to the workspace.

#### Collaborating on sandboxes

Anyone with edit permissions to the workspace can edit its sandboxes.

Sandboxes are tied to the workspace. Anyone in the workspace can move sandboxes between folders, however only the creator a sandbox can permenatly delete a sandbox.
Admins may move sandboxes to different workspaces. This is done by opening the right-clicking on a sandbox in the dashboard, selecting `Move to folder` and selecting a different workspace from the menu.

If you want to collaborate live with workspace members, you can start a [live session](/learn/getting-started/collaborate-share) (with a Pro subscription).

#### Collaborating on repositories

Similarly, anyone with edit access to the team workspace can edit its repositories — as long as they also have write access to the repository on the git provider (such as GitHub). Branches have their own development environments for each workspace, so files saved on `my-branch` of a repository in your personal workspace will not appear on `my-branch` in the team workspace until they are committed and pushed to the git provider.

Live collaboration on branches is restricted to members of the same workspace. If you don't see your collaboration partners working, you may be looking at the same branch in a different workspace. Otherwise, your work will be visible in every workspace as soon as it is committed and pushed to the git provider.

You can learn more about how to work with collaborators in the sections on [repository](/learn/repositories/collaborate-share) collaboration.

## Creating a new workspace

You can create a workspace directly from the workspace selector:

## Managing workspaces and subscriptions

You can create and manage workspaces from the dashboard settings page.
To find this, select your workspace and open the subscription page.

![Team settings](../images/workspace-team-settings-btn.png)

Here you can see the team overview with subscription details, team members and roles.
Admins can edit team member access and roles here as well as edit the subscription.

## Transitioned personal workspaces

As of Nov 12, 2023 all personal workspaces act as standard workspaces.
Previously, everyone that signed up for a CodeSandbox account would automatically have a personal workspace created for them.
This workspace would hold

- your account details
- your contribution branches
- all the sandboxes created in the workspace

However, there was no option to add people to the workspace or upgrade the space.
With the recent changes, every workspace will be treated the same. The means that workspaces that were previously a free personal can

#### Add collaborators

Just like in pro workspace, you may add members to the workspace by navigating to the workspace settings, and either sending an invite url or entering an email that will send off an invitation.

#### Upgrade to pro

Every workspace can now be upgraded. By selecting any action to upgrade from within a workspace, you will be able

#### Access account details from any workspace

Account information is now held in a separate account view. You can access it from the main menu within `preferences`

If you have a legacy personal pro account, some of these options may vary.
