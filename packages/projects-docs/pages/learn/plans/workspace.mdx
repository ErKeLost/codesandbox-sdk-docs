# Workspaces
![Workspaces](../images/workspace-selector.png)

CodeSandbox uses **Workspaces** to provide personal and collaborative experiences. You can think of workspaces as the boundaries for collaboration on CodeSandbox: use a [personal workspace](#personal-workspace) for public, individual development work, and use a [Pro workspace](#pro-workspace) for any type of work requiring privacy or collaboration with others.

Every sandbox belongs to a workspace, and every branch of a repository has a separate development environment in each workspace. If you are working on something in your personal workspace and decide to collaborate with others, it may be necessary to transfer (in the case of a sandbox) or re-import (in the case of a repository) your work to a Pro workspace.

## Personal Workspace

By default, when you set up an account, you have a free personal workspace. This is a space to create, prototype and build anything you like. You can think of this workspace as your local development transferred to the cloud. The personal workspace contains any public sandboxes and repositories you added while active in your workspace.

**Sandboxes**: Your personal workspace contains any public sandboxes created while in that workspace. If you want to make any of these sandboxes unlisted or private, you will need to create a [Pro workspace](##pro-workspace) and transfer the sandboxes to that workspace. 

**Repositories**: Personal workspaces also contain any public repositories that are imported while that workspace was active. To collaborate with others, you will have to re-import the repository to a team workspace that includes your collaboration partners.

Your personal workspace also contains a section for your [open source contributions](/learn/getting-started/open-source#introducing-contribution-branches).

### Personal Pro
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
Personal Pro has been depricated in favor of [Pro workspaces](##pro-workspace). Existing personal Pro subscriptions will continue to be supported in their current form.

## Pro Workspace 

Pro workspaces are for private development and collaboration. 
If you want to work together with a friend or colleague on a sandbox or repository, start by creating a Pro workspace and inviting them to join you.

**Sandboxes**: Anyone with edit permi to the Pro workspace can edit its sandboxes. If you want to collaborate live with workspace members, you can start a [live session](/learn/getting-started/collaborate-share) (with a Pro subscription).

**Repositories**: Similarly, anyone with edit access to the team workspace can edit its repositories — as long as they also have write access to the repository on the git provider (such as GitHub). Branches have their own development environments for each workspace, so files saved on `my-branch` of a repository in your personal workspace will not appear on `my-branch` in the team workspace until they are committed and pushed to the git provider.

### Creating a Pro workspace

You can get started with Pro with a free trial. 

![Create a team](../images/workspace-create-team.png)

Or create a team from the workspace selector:

### Inviting People to a workspace

You can add as many members to a Pro workspace as you like. You can invite them when you are creating the workspace for the first time, or later through the subscription management view.

![Invite team members](../images/workspace-invite-members.png)

Users with an active CodeSandbox account will get a notification (the bell icon in the header) in CodeSandbox as well as an email. 
From there, they can accept or decline the invitation.

You can also invite workspace members that do not have a CodeSandbox account. They will be sent an email inviting them to create an account where they will have access to the workspace.


### Managing workspaces and subscriptions

You can create and manage workspaces from the dashboard settings page.
To find this, select your workspace and open the subscription page.

![Team settings](../images/workspace-team-settings.png)

Here you can see the team overview with subscription details, team members and roles.
Admins can edit team member access and roles here as well as edit the subscription.

Free teams have been depricated. Existing free team subscriptions will continue to be supported in their current form.

### Collaboration in workspaces

#### Sharing Sandboxes

You can choose which workspace you're in from the team drop-down at the top-left on
the dashboard. You can create new sandboxes directly from here or from a
different team, select one or more sandboxes, right-click and select 'Move to
Folder', where you can choose the team and folder you want to move them into.
All sandboxes in a team can be seen or edited by other team members, depending
on their permission levels. We keep track of who created the sandbox, though,
and only the original creator of the sandbox can delete it.

#### Collaborating on sandboxes

You and other members of a workspace can open a sandbox at the same time and see each other's cursor to work together. You can still invite other people who aren't members of the team to the sandbox or host a [live session](/learn/getting-started/collaborate-share).

#### Collaborating on repositories

While sandboxes belong to only one workspace, repositories can exist in multiple workspaces at once. This means that users with write access to a repository may import it to their personal workspace while another team may import the same repository to work on it together.

Live collaboration on branches is restricted to members of the same workspace. If you don't see your collaboration partners working, you may be looking at the same branch in a different workspace. Otherwise, your work will be visible in every workspace as soon as it is committed and pushed to the git provider.
