# Pricing FAQs

## FAQs
### My Devbox is frozen. What does that mean?
The VM will become frozen if the workspace does not have enough available credits to run a VM. You may encounter a frozen state if:
- you are on a Free workspace and you have run out of credits;
- you are on a Pro workspace but your credit spend has hit the spending limit.

To get out of the frozen state, you can either upgrade to Pro (if you are on Free) or adjust your spending limit. Otherwise, you must wait until the start of the next billing cycle for your credits to renew.

### The Sandbox that I want to use is restricted. What do I do?
If you have Sandboxes over the limit of your subscription, you have two choices. You can regain access to the Sandboxes in two ways:
- by upgrading your workspace to Pro;
- by converting your Sandbox to a Devbox (all plans include unlimited Devboxes).
