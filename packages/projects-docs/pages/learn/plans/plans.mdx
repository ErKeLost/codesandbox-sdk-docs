# Plans 


### Free 
Our Free tier is designed to make it very easy to start using CodeSandbox. 
Every Free workspace gets 400 free monthly credits, providing a great option for hobbyists to run a small side project. For example, it's enough to develop a small React web app for 40 hours per month on a Nano VM. 
The Free tier is also a good option for anyone wanting to evaluate how much VM usage they need before upgrading to a plan with more credits.

Note that if the free credits run out before the end of the billing cycle, all Devboxes and Repositories will enter into a [frozen state](#my-devbox-is-frozen-what-does-that-mean). 

In addition to the monthly free credits, the free tier also provides access to 20 Sandboxes. 
Unlike Devboxes and repositories, Sandboxes do not run on credits. Instead, there are multiple options for accessing sandboxes at a flat rate. This is described more in the following section.

### Pro 
Pro provides access to a higher baseline of usage as well as the option to customize your subscription with [add-ons](#addons) and [on-demand credits](/learn/credit-usage/credits#on-demand-credits). 
Pro usage offers:
- 1000 monthly credits
- 50 GB storage
- 20 members
- access to higher VM specs
- 100 Sandboxes
- unlimited personal drafts


### Add-ons
Add-ons allow you to customize your workspace to meet your unique needs.
There is a range of add-ons for both credits and sandboxes with savings included for bulk purchases. 


### Sandboxes 
Sandboxes do not run on VMs, so any time spent on a Sandbox will not count toward your credit spend.
