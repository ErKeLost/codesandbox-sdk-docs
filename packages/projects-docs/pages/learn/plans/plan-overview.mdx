# Plans


Our usage-based billing system is designed to provide a flexible and cost-effective approach to managing your workspace. It's based on a credit system, where credits translate virtual machine (VM) runtime per hour into precise costs.

## Key components
### Virtual Machines
Our Devboxes and Repositories run on VMs, which allow you to develop, review and preview your software projects. As such, VMs are the backbone of our usage measurement.

### Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. They simplify understanding and managing the costs of running your Devboxes and Repositories. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, which ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.

There are three types of credits:

**Subscription credits:** the allocation of monthly credits provided to a workspace according to the subscription tier. Unused credits do not roll over month-to-month.

**On-demand credits**: credits that are automatically billed to the user once the subscription credits have been used. All on-demand credits are subject to a spend limit which is set by admins during the pro upgrade process. This limit is designed to ensure that workspaces don't incur any surprise expenses.

**Purchased credits**: credits that can be purchased at any time. These credits are available in packages of 500 credits and will be invoiced separately from the subscription. Purchased credits do not expire.

| VM size | Credits / hour | Cost / hour | CPU      | RAM    |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nano   | 10 credits     | $0.18       | 2 cores  | 4 GB   |
| Micro  | 20 credits     | $0.36       | 4 cores  | 8 GB   |
| Small  | 40 credits     | $0.72       | 8 cores  | 16 GB  |
| Medium | 80 credits     | $1.44       | 16 cores | 32 GB  |
| Large  | 160 credits    | $2.88       | 32 cores | 64 GB  |
| XLarge | 320 credits    | $5.76       | 64 cores | 128 GB |

### Storage
Each subscription tier has a specific storage limit. The storage refers to the VM disk space limit of _each_ Devbox or Repository branch running in that workspace.
For example, the Free tier includes 20 GB of storage. So, every Devbox or Repository branch running on a VM will have 20 GB of storage.
If the storage included in your subscription tier isn't enough, you can upgrade to a higher tier of Pro.

## Pricing 
### Free 
Our Free tier is designed to make it very easy to start using CodeSandbox. 
Every Free workspace gets 400 free monthly credits, providing a great option for hobbyists to run a small side project. For example, it's enough to develop a small React web app for 40 hours per month on a Nano VM. 
The Free tier is also a good option for anyone wanting to evaluate how much VM usage they need before upgrading to a plan with more credits.

Note that if the free credits run out before the end of the billing cycle, all Devboxes and Repositories will enter into a [frozen state](#my-devbox-is-frozen-what-does-that-mean). 

In addition to the monthly free credits, the free tier also provides access to 20 Sandboxes. 
Unlike Devboxes and repositories, Sandboxes do not run on credits. Instead, there are multiple options for accessing sandboxes at a flat rate. This is described more in the following section.

### Pro 
A fee of $9/mo opens a workspace gains access to an additional 600 credits (1000 total), a total of 50GB storage and up to 100 sandboxes. 
Pro workspaces gain access to `on-demand credits` and options to purchase add-ons. 

### Add-ons
Add-ons allow you to customize your workspace to meet your unique needs.
There is a range of add-ons for both credits and sandboxes with savings included for bulk purchases. 


### Sandboxes 
Sandboxes do not run on VMs, so any time spent on a Sandbox will not count toward your credit spend.
