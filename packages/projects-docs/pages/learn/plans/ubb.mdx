# Usage-based billing

Our usage-based billing system is designed to provide a flexible and cost-effective approach to managing your workspace. Our system operates on a credit-based model, translating virtual machine usage into precise costs per hour spent. This documentation aims to guide you through the exciting features and perks of our usage-based billing system, offering you a seamless and customizable experience.

## Key components
### Virtual Machines
Our system operates within a virtualized environment, where Devboxes and Repositories run on virtual machines. These virtual machines are the backbone of our usage measurement, providing you with the computational power required for your projects.

### Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for virtual machine usage. They allow you to easily understand and manage the costs associated with running your virtual machines. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour. This streamlined approach ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.

There are three types of credits:

**Subscription credits:** the allocation of credits per month that is provided to a workspace according to the subscription tier. Unused credits do not rollover month-to-month.
**On-demand credits**: credits that are billed to the user once the subscription credits have been used
**Purchased credits**: credits can be purchased at anytime. These credits are available in packages of 500 credits and will be invoiced separately from the subscription. Purchased credits do not expire.

|        | Credits / hour | Cost / hour | CPU      | RAM    |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nano   | 10 credits     | $0.18       | 2 cores  | 4 GB   |
| Micro  | 20 credits     | $0.36       | 4 cores  | 8 GB   |
| Small  | 40 credits     | $0.72       | 8 cores  | 16 GB  |
| Medium | 80 credits     | $1.44       | 16 cores | 32 GB  |
| Large  | 160 credits    | $2.88       | 32 cores | 64 GB  |
| XLarge | 320 credits    | $5.76       | 64 cores | 128 GB |

### Storage
Each subscription tier has a storage limit associated with it. The storage refers to the VM disk space limit. 
For example, the free tier includes 30GB storage. For every Devboxes or repo branch running on a VM will have 30GB of storage.
If the free tier of storage isn't enough, you can upgrade to higher tier of Pro or purchase a storage [add-on](#add-ons).

## Pricing 
### Free tier
We believe that getting started with CodeSandbox should be as easy as possible. Our free tier is designed to provide hobbyists enough free credits to run a small side project. 
If you are looking to evaluate how much VM usage you need, simple get started on Free and upgrade when you need more credits.
Every free workspace gets 400 free credits. That is enough to develop a small react web app for 40 hours on Nano. 
If the credits run out before the end of the month, all Devboxes and repositories will enter into a [frozen state](#my-devbox-is-frozen-what-does-that-mean). 

### Pro tiers
There are a number of Pro tiers to choose from. Every Pro tier includes subscription credits. The higher the tier, the more you save on these credits. Once these credits are used, the VMs will start running on `On-demand` credits. These credits will be aggregated and added to the end-of-month invoice.
In order to prevent any surprise expense, each workspace is required to set a max-spend limit. Once the on-demand credits have hit the limit, it will freeze until more credits have been added or the next billing cycle begins.

### Sandboxes 
Sandboxes do not run on VMs meaning that any time spent on a Sandbox will not count toward your credit spend. 
However, every subscription tier has a Sandbox limit. If you want access to more Sandboxes, you can upgrade to a higher tier of Pro or purchase a Sandbox add-on.

### Add-ons
Add-ons are a way of customizing your workspace to meet your unique needs. If for example you want more Sandboxes but don't want to upgrade your subscription, you can simply purchase more through the add-ons.

### Old pricing plans
Starting on Jan 23rd, 2023, all new and existing free workspaces will transition to usage-based billing. Existing Pro workspaces may opt to switch to usage-based billing, but will not be required to for the time being.






## FAQs
### My Devbox is frozen, what does that mean?
If the workspace does not have enough available credits to run a VM, the VM will become frozen. You may encounter a frozen state if
- you are on a free workspace and you have run out of credits
- you are on a Pro workspace but your credit spend has hit the spending limit 
In order to get out of the frozen state, you can either upgrade to Pro (if you are on free) or adjust your spending limit. Otherwise, you will need to wait till the start of the next billing cycle for your credits to renew.

### The Sandbox that I want to use is restricted, what do I do?
If you have Sandboxes that are over the limit for your subscription, you have two choices. You can regain access to the Sandboxes by upgrading your workspace to Pro, or your can convert your Sandbox to a Devbox
