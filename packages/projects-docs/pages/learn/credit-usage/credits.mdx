### Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. They simplify understanding and managing the costs of running your Devboxes and Repositories. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, which ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.

There are three types of credits:

**Subscription credits:** the allocation of monthly credits provided to a workspace according to the subscription tier. Unused credits do not roll over month-to-month.

**On-demand credits**: credits that are automatically billed to the user once the subscription credits have been used.

**Purchased credits**: credits that can be purchased at any time. These credits are available in packages of 500 credits and will be invoiced separately from the subscription. Purchased credits do not expire.
