# Credits

Credits serve as the unit of measurement for VM runtime. They simplify understanding and managing the costs of running your Devboxes and Repositories. One credit equates to a specific amount of resources used per hour, which ensures clarity and transparency in your billing.

| VM size | Credits / hour | Cost / hour | CPU      | RAM    |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Pico    | 5 credits      | $0.0743     | 2 cores  | 1 GB   |
| Nano    | 10 credits     | $0.1486     | 2 cores  | 4 GB   |
| Micro   | 20 credits     | $0.2972     | 4 cores  | 8 GB   |
| Small   | 40 credits     | $0.5944     | 8 cores  | 16 GB  |
| Medium  | 80 credits     | $1.1888     | 16 cores | 32 GB  |
| Large   | 160 credits    | $2.3776     | 32 cores | 64 GB  |
| XLarge  | 320 credits    | $4.7552     | 64 cores | 128 GB |

Sandboxes do not run on VMs, so any time spent on a Sandbox will not count toward your credit spend.

## Types of credits

### Subscription credits

Subscription credits are allocated monthly credits per workspace according to the subscription plan. A workspace on the free plan gets 400 credits per month. The Pro plan has a base of 1000 credits a month, but more can be purchased with credit add-ons.

### On-demand credits

Once subscription credits have been used, VM usage will begin running on on-demand credits. These credits will be tracked and billed at the end of the billing cycle.
On-demand credits are not subject to discount and are billed at a standard $0.1486 per hour.

To prevent unexpected bills due to unusually high on-demand credit usage, every Pro workspace is required to set a [spending limit](/learn/credit-usage/controlling-usage#spending-limit).
