# Controlling VM Usage


## Privacy

VM run time is billed to the workspace that owns the devbox or repository. 
VMs are required to run the code regardless of whether or not the code is being actively developed. This means that workspaces are responsible for the runtime of any project in their workspace, including running previews or spinning up the code for `read-only` users. 

Making Devboxes private allows workspace admins to have finer control over total VM expense. For this reason, Devboxes are created as private by default. Devbox and Sandbox privacy defaults can be controlled via the `Permissions` tab in the [workspace portal](codesandbox.io/t/permissions). 

## Templates

VM runtime for templates are covered by CodeSandbox.
By setting a Devbox as a template, you can share your work without worrying about the costs associ for the VMs required to run the Devbox a good way to share devbox content with the public without paying for VMs
if you want to edit the devbox, you will have to change the settings temporarily so it is no longer a template.
This ensures that you only pay for VM use that is required for your own development

## VM settings


## Spending limit
On-demand credits will never exceed the spending limit. 
Once subscription credits are used, the VMs will start running on on-demand credits. These credits will be aggregated and added to the end-of-month invoice.

Every Pro workspace is required to have a max spending limit to ensure that there are no surprise bills at the end of the billing cycle. 
The spending limit is initially set in the Pro subscription check-out flow. Workspace admins can adjust this spending limit in the workspace portal at anytime. 

Once the on-demand credits hit that limit, all Devboxes and Repositories will enter a [frozen state](/learn/plans/pricing-faq#my-devbox-is-frozen-what-does-that-mean) until more credits have been added or the next billing cycle begins.
