# Controlling VM Usage

There are a number of ways that a workspace can control the use of virtual machines. By using the following tools, a workspace can increase predictibility of VM usage and credit spend. 


## Privacy

VM run time is billed to the workspace that owns the devbox or repository. 
VMs are required to run the code regardless of whether or not the code is being actively developed. This means that workspaces are responsible for the runtime of any project in their workspace, including running previews or spinning up the code for `read-only` users. 

Making Devboxes private allows workspace admins to have finer control over total VM expense. For this reason, Devboxes are created as private by default. Devbox and Sandbox privacy defaults can be controlled via the `Permissions` tab in the [workspace portal](codesandbox.io/t/permissions). 

## Templates

VM runtime for templates are covered by CodeSandbox.
By setting a Devbox as a template, you can share your work without worrying about the costs associated with non-workspace users running your Devbox. 
Once a Devbox is in a template state, it cannot be edited. If you want to continue amking changes to the Deboox, you will need to switch the Devbox back out of template mode.

## Spending limit
On-demand credits will never exceed the spending limit. 
Once subscription credits are used, the VMs will start running on on-demand credits. These credits will be aggregated and added to the end-of-month invoice.

Every Pro workspace is required to have a max spending limit to ensure that there are no surprise bills at the end of the billing cycle. 
The spending limit is initially set in the Pro subscription check-out flow. Workspace admins can adjust this spending limit in the workspace portal at anytime. 

Once the on-demand credits hit that limit, all Devboxes and Repositories will enter a [frozen state](/learn/plans/pricing-faq#my-devbox-is-frozen-what-does-that-mean) until more credits have been added or the next billing cycle begins.
