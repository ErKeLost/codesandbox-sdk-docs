# Monitoring usage

VM usage is reported in the workspace portal under the [virtual machine usage tab](https://codesandbox.io/t/usage).
In this view, you can find information relating the workspace credit spend during the current cycle as well as logs from each session.

## Understanding VM starts and stops

There are two different ways to wake-up a VM. Through user interaction, such as spinning up a repository branch in the editor or though automated jobs like making an HTTP wakeup call to start up a preview.
These job related starts usually add up to a few mins of VM time in a billing cycle and they are accounted for in the VM usage logs in the workspace portal. 

Hibernation time-outs are a way to conserve VM use. If a VM has not had any interactivity for 30 mins, it will go into hibernation until woken up again.
