# Update Sandbox

You can update your Sandbox after creation.

```ts
import { VMTier } from '@codesandbox/sdk'

const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

// You can hot swap the VM tier
await sandbox.updateTier(VMTier.Micro)
await sandbox.updateHibernationTimeout(60)
```

<Callout>
You can not update the `ipcountry` of a created Sandbox. This is because the IP country is set when the Sandbox is created and is used to determine the region the Sandbox is running in.
</Callout>

## Update Agent

Every Sandbox has an agent running on it. This agent is the what allows you to interact with the Sandbox environment.

When a new version of the agent is published, existing sandboxes will need to restart before they get new version.

You can check if the current sandbox is up to date using `isUpToDate()`

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

if (!sandbox.isUpToDate) {
    await sdk.sandboxes.restart(sandbox.id)
}
```

It is up to you to decide what the best user experience will be for your use case. At CodeSandbox we would show a notification when the agent was out of date and the user could choose when to update.
