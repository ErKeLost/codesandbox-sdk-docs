# Update Sandbox

Every Sandbox has an agent running on it. This agent is the what allows you to interact with the Sandbox environment
When a new version of the agent is published existing sandboxes needs to restart to get that new version.

You can check if the current sandbox is up to date using `isUpToDate()`

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.resume('sandbox-id')

if (!sandbox.isUpToDate) {
    await sdk.sandbox.restart(sandbox.id)
}
```

It is up to you deciding on the best user experience. At CodeSandbox we would show a notification when the agent was out of date and the user could choose when to update.
