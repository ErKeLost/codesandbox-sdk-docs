# Create Sandbox

Sandboxes are the main building blocks of the CodeSandbox SDK. Each one represents a single project that you can run, fork, and modify.

Every Sandbox is backed by a Firecracker VM, and is completely isolated and persisted. Providing you with a secure environment to run untrusted code.

## Creating a Sandbox

To create a sandbox, call `sandbox.create()`:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'
const sdk = new CodeSandbox();

const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
```

If no argument is provided to `sandbox.create()`, we'll create a sandbox based on our [Universal](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/universal-pcz35m) template on CodeSandbox. You can also pass in a specific template id from [our collection of templates](/sdk/snapshot-library) or by creating your own snapshot using our [Snapshot Builder](/sdk/snapshot-builder). Additionally you can choose other sources like [Git](/sdk/sandbox#git) or [Files](/sdk/sandbox#files).

### Create from Template

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    source: 'template',
    id: 'some-sandbox-id'
})
```

### Create from Git

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    source: 'git',
    url: 'https://...',
    branch: 'main',
    // Optionally pass necessary git config for private repos etc.
    config: {
      accessToken: 'github-token',
      email: 'foo@bar.com',
      name: 'Foo Bar'
    },
    async setup(session) {
        await session.commands.run('pnpm install')
        await session.commands.run('pnpm run dev')
        await session.ports.waitForPort(5173)
    }
})
```

<Callout>
It depends on the repo how you want to setup the sandbox. If it is configured with tasks you can run `session.setup.run()` to run the full setup, but if configured with a `.devcontainer` you want to restart the sandbox itself. Or you can do like the example just run some commands.
</Callout>

### Additional options

For any of the above sources you can also pass the following options:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    source: 'template',
    title: 'my-sandbox',
    description: 'My sandbox',
    tags: ['my-tag'],
    privacy: 'public'
    path: '/users/some-user-folder'
})
```

## Sandbox Properties

The `sandbox` object represents the instance of a sandbox running in our infrastructure. The methods detailed below require the Sandbox to be running.

Each Sandbox has the following properties, with information about it's own instance:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the sandbox.
- `isUpToDate`: Whether the sandbox is up to date with the latest agent version.
- `cluster`: The cluster the sandbox is running on.
- `bootupType`: The type of bootup, `RUNNING`, `CLEAN`, `RESUME` or `FORK`.

## Resume an Existing Sandbox

To resume an existing sandbox from hibernation and connect to it call: `sdk.sandboxes.resume(id)`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id');
```

<Callout>
Sandboxes that have been dormant for a week may take longer to start as they will need to run their [setup](/sdk/setup) before resuming.
