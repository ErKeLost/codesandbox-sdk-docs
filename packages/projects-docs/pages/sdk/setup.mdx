# Setup

Setup tasks are configured in your project's `.codesandbox/tasks.json` file. This file defines both setup tasks that run when the sandbox starts, and regular tasks that can be run on-demand.

Setup tasks run in order when initializing your sandbox. They're typically used for installation and preparation steps:

```json
{
  "setupTasks": [
    {
      "name": "Install Dependencies",
      "command": "pnpm install"
    },
    {
      "name": "Copy Environment File",
      "command": "cp .env.example .env"
    },
    "pnpm run build"  // Short form for { "name": "pnpm run build", "command": "pnpm run build" }
  ]
}
```

## API

Setup tasks run automatically when a sandbox starts. They typically handle installation of dependencies and initial builds. You can monitor and control setup tasks using the Setup API:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

// Listen to setup progress
session.setup.onSetupProgressUpdate((progress) => {
  console.log(`Setup progress: ${progress.currentStepIndex + 1}/${progress.steps.length}`);
  console.log(`Current step: ${progress.steps[progress.currentStepIndex].name}`);
});

// Get current progress
const progress = await session.setup.getProgress();
console.log(`Setup state: ${progress.state}`);

// Wait for setup to finish
const result = await session.setup.waitForFinish();
if (result.state === "FINISHED") {
  console.log("Setup completed successfully");
}
```

### Setup Progress

The setup progress includes the following information:

```ts
type SetupProgress = {
  state: "IDLE" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "FINISHED" | "STOPPED";
  steps: {
    name: string;
    command: string;
    shellId: string | null;
    finishStatus: "SUCCEEDED" | "FAILED" | "SKIPPED" | null;
  }[];
  currentStepIndex: number;
};
```

## Setup Tasks vs Docker Build: When to Use Which?

Setup tasks are used for any preparation work needed in the `/project/sandbox` directory, such as:

- Installing dependencies
- Building assets
- Running initial compilations

Docker build, on the other hand, should be used for:

- Setting up the container environment
- Installing system-level dependencies
- Configuring global tools

This separation exists because the `/project/sandbox` directory is only available after the container starts.
