# Templates

CodeSandbox has default templates that you can use to create sandboxes. These templates are available in the [Template Library](/sdk/snapshot-library) and by default we use the "Universal" template. To create your own template you will need to use our CLI.

## Creating the template

Create a new folder in your project and add the files you want to have available inside your Sandbox. For example set up a Vite project:

```sh
npx create-vite@latest my-template
```

Now we need to configure the template with tasks so that it will install dependencies and start the dev server. Create a `.codesandbox/tasks.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "setupTasks": [
        "npm install"
    ],
    "tasks": {
        "dev-server": {
            "name": "Dev Server",
            "command": "npm run dev",
            "runAtStart": true
        }
    }
}
```

The `setupTasks` will run after the Sandbox has started, before any other tasks.

Now we are ready to deploy the template to our clusters, run:

```bash
$ CSB_API_KEY=KEY npx @codesandbox/sdk build ./my-template --ports 5173
```

This will start the process of creating Sandboxes for each of our clusters, write files, restart, wait for port 5173 to be available and then hibernate. This generates the snapshot.

When all clusters are updated successfully you will get a "Template Tag" back which you can use when you create your sandboxes.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    source: 'template',
    id: 'some-template-tag'
})
```

Read more about building templates in the [Build Templates](/sdk/build-templates).

<Callout>
Even though the `build` process logs the specific Sandbox ids generated, you should never visit these sandboxes. They are meant to stay hibernated and only by used as snapshots. Creating a Sandbox from a running template is **slower** than creating a Sandbox from a snapshot. In the near future templates can not be started again after hibernation.
