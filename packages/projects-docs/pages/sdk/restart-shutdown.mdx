# Restart & Shutdown

## Restart

Restarting a Sandbox starts it from a clean slate. It will install and build its configured resources and also run with the last version of the agent.

```ts
const sandbox = sdk.sandbox.ref('sandbox-id')


await sandbox.restart();
```

## Shutdown

You can also shutdown a sandbox. This will shut down the sandbox without creating a memory snapshot. Next time the sandbox is started, it will boot from a clean state (but your files in `/project/sandbox` will be preserved).

```ts
const sandbox = sdk.sandbox.ref('sandbox-id')

await sandbox.shutdown();
```

Generally you should shutdown a sandbox if you want to start from a clean state.
