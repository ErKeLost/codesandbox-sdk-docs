# Restart & Shutdown

## Restart

Restarting a Sandbox starts it from a clean slate. It will install and build its configured resources and also run with the last version of the agent.

```ts
let sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.resume('sandbox-id')

sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.restart(sandbox.id);
```

<Callout>
Note that when restarting you get a new reference to the Sandbox. You will need to create a new session from that new reference.
</Callout>

## Shutdown

You can also shutdown a sandbox. This will shut down the sandbox without creating a memory snapshot. Next time the sandbox is started, it will boot from a clean state (but your files in `/project/sandbox` will be preserved).

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.resume('sandbox-id')

await sdk.sandbox.shutdown(sandbox.id);
```

Generally you should shutdown a sandbox if you want to start from a clean state.
