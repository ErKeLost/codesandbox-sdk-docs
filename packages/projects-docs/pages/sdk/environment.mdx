# Environment

Sandboxes on CodeSandbox are backed by a [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVM. Within the VM we run a rootless Docker container based on a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration (specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file).

## Booting a Sandbox

Whenever we boot a sandbox from scratch, we'll:

1. Start the Firecracker VM
2. Create a default user (called `pitcher-host`)
3. (optional) Build the Docker image specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
4. Start the Docker container
5. Mount the `/project/sandbox` directory as a volume inside the Docker container

We then run an agent inside the VM that the SDK connects to via an RPC protocol. You can then interact with the sandbox through this agent.
