# Connect

The default session for a Sandbox is a WebSocket connection. This connection is designed to hold a session over time with minimum overhead to message passing. The WebSocket connection also allows you to listen to changes to ports, shell output etc.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

await session.fs.writeTextFile('test.txt', 'Hello World');
```

## Disconnecting the Session

Disconnecting the session will end the session and automatically hibernate the sandbox after a timeout.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.resume('sandbox-id')
const session = await sandbox.connect()

await session.disconnect();
```
