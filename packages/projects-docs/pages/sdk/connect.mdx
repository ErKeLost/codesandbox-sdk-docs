# Connect

The default session for a Sandbox is a WebSocket connection. This connection is designed to hold a session over time with minimum overhead to message passing. The WebSocket connection also allows you to listen to changes to ports, shell output and so on.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

await session.fs.writeTextFile('test.txt', 'Hello World');
```

## Disconnecting the Session

Disconnecting the session ends the session and will automatically hibernate the sandbox after a timeout.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')
const session = await sandbox.connect()

// Disconnect returns a promise of when all pending
// messages are handled and socket is actually disconnected
session.disconnect();
```
