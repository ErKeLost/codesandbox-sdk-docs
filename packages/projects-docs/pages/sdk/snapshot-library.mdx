# SDK Snapshots

All sandboxes created by the CodeSandbox SDK are created from a snapshot. Even if you don't pass an argument to `sdk.sandbox.create`, we will fork the "Universal" snapshot to create a new sandbox for you.

This is because the concept of forking is a part of the core foundations of CodeSandbox. It allows you to create a template that contains all your necessary dependencies, files, or even running servers and then clone it as many times as you would like to create new sandboxes.

## Starting from a Snapshot

You can start from a snapshot by passing the template id to the `sdk.sandbox.create` method.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create({
  template: 'template-id'
})
```

## Templates

Below are the official templates on CodeSandbox that you can start experimenting with. You can click on the id on the right to copy the id to your clipboard and use it in your sandbox. Click on the title to open the template in the CodeSandbox editor to inspect it:
