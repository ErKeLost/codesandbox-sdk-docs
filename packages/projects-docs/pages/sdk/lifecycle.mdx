# Sandbox Lifecycle

By default a Sandbox will be created from a template. A template is a memory/fs snapshot of a Sandbox, meaning it will be a direct continuation of the template. If the template was running a dev server, that dev server is running when the Sandbox is created.

When you create, resume or restart a Sandbox you can access its `bootupType`. This value indicates how the Sandbox was started.

- **FORK**: The Sandbox was created from a template. This happens when you call `create` successfully.
- **RUNNING**: The Sandbox was already running. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was already running.
- **RESUME**: The Sandbox was resumed from hibernation. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was hibernated.
- **CLEAN**: The Sandbox was created or resumed from scratch. This happens when you call `create` or `resume` and the Sandbox was not running and was missing a snapshot. This can happen if the Sandbox was shut down, restarted, the snapshot was expired (old snapshot) or if something went wrong.

## Managing CLEAN bootups

Whenever we boot a sandbox from scratch, we'll:

1. Start the Firecracker VM
2. Create a default user (called `pitcher-host`)
3. (optional) Build the Docker image specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
4. Start the Docker container
5. Mount the `/project/sandbox` directory as a volume inside the Docker container

You will be able to connect to the Sandbox during this process and track its progress.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

const setupSteps = sandbox.setup.getSteps()

for (const step of setupSteps) {
  console.log(`Step: ${step.name}`);
  console.log(`Command: ${step.command}`);
  console.log(`Status: ${step.status}`);

  const output = await step.open()

  output.onOutput((output) => {
    console.log(output)
  })

  await step.waitUntilComplete()
}
```
